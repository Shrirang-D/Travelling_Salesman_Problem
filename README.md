# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solvers

This repository contains Python implementations of two approaches to solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP): a brute force approach and a Simulated Annealing approach.

## Brute Force TSP Solver

### Overview

The `TSP_Brute_Force_Method.ipynb` script demonstrates the brute force method to solve the TSP. It exhaustively calculates all possible permutations of cities to find the shortest route.

## Brute Force TSP Solver

### Overview

The `TSP_using_Simulated_Annealing.ipynb` script demonstrates the Simulated Annealing method to solve the TSP. It uses a probabilistic optimization approach to find an approximate solution.
